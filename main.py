#f1 = (2 * P-micro * Rmicro) / P-micro + R-micro

#also referred as f1 = (2 * (Precision * Recall)) / (Precision + Recall)

#Precision = Correct positive predictions relative to total positive predictions
#P = TP / (TP + FP)

#Recalls = Correct positive predictions relative to total actual positives
#Recalls = TP / (TP + FN)
