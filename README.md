# CSC5240_EarthquakeModeling
Shared Repository between Joshua Foster and Kester Nucum for Earthquake Modeling Project.

All python implementations were made in Jupyter Notebook to take advantage of data visualization functions in python.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In able to run these files, you must first install Jupyter Notebook. Here is a link to the Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.

Next, you must launch Jupyter Notebook. Here is a link to the Jupyter Notebook Running Guide: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html.

Now that you have Jupyter Notebook installed and running, you should be able to navigate to the folder contatining the .ipynb files you have downloaded from this repository. Once you have the file(s) opened in Jupyter Notebook, it is as simple as pushing the run button to run each individual cell. To run all at once, you can push the 'refresh' icon that will restart the kernel and run all cells.

Located in this repository is 5 .ipynb files:

1. ModelAnalysis-Baseline.ipynb - contains the python implementations of the baseline models we used to evaluate which baseline model we wanted to use without preprocessing.
2. ModelAnalysis.ipynb - contains the python implementations of the baseline models we used plus some preprocessing.
3. RandomForest.ipynb - contains python implementation of the RandomForestClassifier model with preprocssing and submission formatting.
4. DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb - contains python implementation of the DecisionTreeClassifier model with preprocessing and submission formatting.
6. LogisticRegression.ipynb - contains python implementation of the LogisticRegression model.

All files can be ran independently!
